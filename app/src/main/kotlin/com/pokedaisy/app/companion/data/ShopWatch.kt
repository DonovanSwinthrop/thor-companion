/**
 * Whether a shop is open - a Poké Mart's BUY / SELL / QUIT menu, its buy screen, its sell bag - so
 * SMART fast-forward stays fast there (GitHub #41: the clerk's lines are printed inside the buy
 * screen, a menu screen to [FfMenuWatch], so they crawled at 1x).
 *
 * No per-game table: every Gen 3 game, decomp or binary hack, opens its shops from a map script's
 * `pokemart` / `pokemartdecoration` / `pokemartdecoration2` command (0x86-0x88 + the item list's
 * pointer), which stops the script right after itself until the shop closes. So a shop is up while
 * a script context's scriptPtr sits just past one of those. The contexts (struct ScriptContext: the
 * global and the immediate one, IWRAM in every game) are found by their shape ([find]) once per ROM.
 * Checked headless on retail Emerald and FireRed (`fixtures/ff_shop`): the menu, the buy screen and
 * the sell bag all point past the clerk's `pokemart`, and the pointer is 0 once the clerk is done.
